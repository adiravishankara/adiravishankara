# About Me

Hi there! I'm @adiravishankara, a Technical Product Manager with a passion for innovation and complex problem-solving. My curiosity drives me to explore diverse fields, from medical devices to robotics and automation.
Over the past few years, I've been deeply involved in developing cutting-edge technologies, including non-invasive diagnostic tools, AI-driven chemical analysis systems, and digital twins for robotic systems. My work spans across consumer hardware, medical devices, and industrial automation, always focusing on user-centric, scientifically-backed solutions.
Currently, I'm particularly excited about the intersection of robotics and healthcare, exploring ways to improve quality of life through innovative technologies. I'm continuously expanding my skills in product discovery, human-centered design, and managing complex hardware/software systems.
My repositories showcase some of the projects I've worked on, reflecting my journey from a curious tinkerer to a technical leader driving impactful innovations.
Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adiravishankara/) or via email at adiravishankara@gmail.com. I'm always open to discussing new ideas, collaborations, or just geeking out about the latest in tech!
