# About Me

Hi Folks! I'm @adiravishankara! I am curious of just about everything and I like taking things apart and trying to remember how to put them back together, with varying success. I've spent a lot of time over the past couple years incubating ideas and projects for both myself and my workplaces. You will see a few of these in the repositories.

I'm currently very interested the development, monitoring and singal processing of radar systems. You might see a blog post soon about this. I'm also currently learning how to develop my KDB+ skills to make faster databases and better tools for timeseries monitoring. 

You can reach me either on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adiravishankara/) or email adiravishankara@gmail.com.
